                        a nice dinner at Applebees.

                        incredibly intelligent and will be great at leading your security teams

                        Walton & Walton, is the best monkey for all your CEO needs. You may lose
                        some employees to his termination-of-employment tantrums, but you'll rake
                        in the cash.
